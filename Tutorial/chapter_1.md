Go To Anywhere
===============

Probably the most frequently used command in Sublime Text. While a project is
 open , you can use this command to move from one file to another, search
symbols defined in a file, go to a specific line number.

Let's try this now. Do as per the following instructions:

1. Press ⌘ (`Command`) + P
2. This shows you Goto Anything panel. Typing name of a file should filter out
   names of files.
3. Type `c1rb` and press ⏎ `enter`
