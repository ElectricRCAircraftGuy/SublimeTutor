=======================

Give yourself a pat on the back. You have already used your first Sublime
Text Shortcut. Let's learn about a similar command `Goto Anything` now.

This is Probably the most frequently used command in Sublime Text. While a
project is open, you can use this command to move from one file to another,
search symbols defined in a file, go to a specific line number.

1. Press ⌘ (`Command`) + P
2. This shows you Goto Anything panel. Typing name of a file should filter out
   names of files.
3. Type `c1rb` and press ⏎ (`enter`)
