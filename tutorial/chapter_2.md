Editing text
=============

In this module we'll learn all the important quick editing actions that sublime
text supports. This would include indenting blocks, inserting line, deleting
words, upper case / lower case transforming, bubbling lines up and down joining
lines and much more. Tighten your gears, this is going to be an interesting
module!

Let's move to the first unit.

1. Press ⌘ (`Command`) + P (`Goto Anything` command)
2. Type `c21` and press ⏎ (`enter`)

Pro tip: `Goto Anything` does fuzzy matching with the file names when you start
typing. In the case above you could also type 21 or chap21 and the result would
be the same.
