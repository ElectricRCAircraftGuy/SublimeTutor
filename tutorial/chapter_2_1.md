Insert line before / after
===========================

If your cursor is place on a line, you can directly add a line above or below
and move your cursor directly to that location.

Insert line before - ⌘ (`command`) + ⇧ (shift) + ⏎ (enter/return)
Insert line after - ⌘ + ⏎

Exercise
---------

1. Place your cursor on the line marked <== in the first block
2. Insert a line before and after using the shortcut `⌘ + ⇧ + ⏎` and `⌘ + ⏎`
   consecutively
3. Each block should now look somewhat like the block below:

```
This is first line

I have been sandwiched between the two above and below <==

This is last line
```

First block
------------

```
This is first line
I have been sandwiched between the two above and below <==
This is last line
```
Second block
------------
```
This is first line
I have been sandwiched between the two above and below <==
This is last line
```

Third block
------------
```
This is first line
I have been sandwiched between the two above and below <==
This is last line
```

Now proceed to next chapter with your familiar `Goto Anything` shortcut. The 
filename is chapter_2_2.md
