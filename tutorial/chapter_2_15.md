Transpose Letter
=================

Over here Sublime follows the default functionality of OSX to transpose letters
of a word. This is different from the way Sublime Text 2 used to deal it, where
you could transpose words as well.

Transpose - ^ (`control`) + T

Exercise
---------

Given below are a few words which are spelled incorrectly, use the transpose
shortcut described above to fix the issues.

For example, in the first word `transpoes` which should actually be `transpose`
place your cursor between the letters `e` and `s` and use the shortcut `^ + T`


1. transpoes
2. exercies
3. shortctu
