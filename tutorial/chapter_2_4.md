Delete / Cut a line
===========================

Delete a line - ^ (`control`) + ⇧ (`shift`) + K

Cut a line - ^ (`control`) + X
  If you put the cursor on any line and press `^ + X` then it would cut the
  whole line and put it in the clipboard. You can later paste it using `^ + V`
  as usual.

Exercise 1
-----------

There are some lines written below, some of them are repeated. You need to make
sure that all the lines appear only once. Use the command `^ + ⇧ + K` to delete
those lines.


1. This is line number one
2. This is line number two
2. This is line number two
3. This is line number three
3. This is line number three
4. This is line number four
5. This is line number five
6. This is line number six
6. This is line number six


Exercise 2
-----------

There are six unique lines written below, you need to sort them and make sure
all their duplicates are deleted. So in the end the remaining list should have
just 6 items. To do this, use `^ + X` to cut a line, `⌥ + ⏎` to enter a new line below a certain line, `^ + V` to paste that line back. Once they are sorted, delete the lines which are not required using `^ + ⇧ + K`.


6. This is line number six
1. This is line number one
6. This is line number six
5. This is line number five
4. This is line number four
3. This is line number three
2. This is line number two
2. This is line number two
3. This is line number three
