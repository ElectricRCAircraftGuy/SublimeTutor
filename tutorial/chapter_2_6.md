Upper / lower case
===================

You can use two handy shortcuts to change the case any text block in Sublime.

Lower case - ⌘ (`command`) + K, ⌘ + L
Upper case - ⌘ + K, ⌘ + U

That is, press `⌘ + K` directly followed by `⌘ + L` or `⌘ + U` to change the 
case. In practice, you don't need to pull your finger from the `⌘ command` key
while doing that. So, press `⌘` with `K` and then lift your finger from `K` 
and press `U` to make an upper case transform.

Exercise
---------

Toggle the case of all the words given below. If the existing case is lower
then make it upper, if the existing case is upper, then make it lower.

```
TOGGLE

OF
all
the
