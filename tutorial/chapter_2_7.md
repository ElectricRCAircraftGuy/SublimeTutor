Joining lines
==============

Sublime Text makes it conveniently easy for you two join two lines into one.

Join two lines - ⌘ (`command`) + J

Exercise
---------

You can notice pairs of lines below. Join the pair of lines into one to form 
one long sentence. Put the cursor anywhere on the first line and press ⌘ (`command`) + J

```
This is a candidate for joining with
another sentence written on next line number.

This is another such example with one line spanning over
two lines.

Join this line with
this line to form a longer line.
