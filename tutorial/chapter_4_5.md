I know what you did last summer
================================

While `undo` and `soft-undo` functionalities are great, they are only limited
to the view you are working with. What if you want to see your cursor movement
across the tabs?

Well, we have a solution here.

Jump back in history - `^ (`control`) + -`
Jump forward in history - `^ (`control`) + â‡§ (`shift`) + -`


Exercise
---------

If you have been following along with me till now, time to see your movement
across files.

1. Try `Jump back` shortcut multiple times (~10-15) and then try `Jump forward`
   shortcut until you reach the current state again.
