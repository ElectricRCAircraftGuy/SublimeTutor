Code folding / unfolding
=========================

When you are working with nested code structures, you can see a folded view
of your code to get a larger picture.

Fold one level - ⌘ (`command`) + ⌥ (`option`) + [
Unfold code one level - ⌘ (`command`) + ⌥ (`option`) + ]

Exercise
---------

Let's try this with the following HTML code structure.

1. Put your cursor inside the `p` text somewhere.
2. Use the `Fold one level` shortcut `⌘ + ⌥ + [`
3. While `⌘` and `⌥` keys are depressed, press `[` key multiple times
   so that whole code structure is completely folded.
4. Now use the shortcut for unfolding code `⌘ + ⌥ + ]` until full code
   is visible.
