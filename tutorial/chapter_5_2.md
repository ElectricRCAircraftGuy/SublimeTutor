Incremental find
=================

I would rather skip this chapter as I personally believe it only adds to
confusion and the `Find...` panel can be better used in place of this. But
I'm covering this here only to make sure that you don't get confused between
the two.

Let's learn the shortcuts first:

Incremental find - ⌘ (`command`) + I (pressing again would find next)
Incremental find reverse - ⌘ (`command`) + ⇧ (`shift`) + I
Inccremental find all - ⌥ (`option`) + ⏎ (`return`)

These commands work exactly as `Find...` except for just one difference. When
we find something using `incremental find`, pressing ⏎ (`return`) directly
takes us to the screen where this word is selected while in the case of
regular find ⎋ (`escape`) key plays that role.
