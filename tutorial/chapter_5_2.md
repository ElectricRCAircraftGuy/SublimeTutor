Incremental find
=================

I would rather skip this chapter as I personally believe it only adds to
confusion and the `Find...` panel can be better used in place of this. But
I'm covering this here only to make sure that you don't get confused between
the two.

Let's learn the shortcuts first:

Incremental find - ^ (`control`) + I (pressing again would find next)
Incremental find previous - ^ (`control`) + ⇧ (`shift`) + I
Incremental find all - ⌥ (`alt`) + ⏎ (`return`)

These commands work exactly as `Find...` except for just one difference. When
we find something using `incremental find`, pressing ⏎ (`return`) directly
takes us to the screen where this word is selected while in the case of
regular find ⎋ (`escape`) key plays that role.

I'm not recommending to practice it. Though, if you wish you have the
following exercise.

Exercise
---------

1. Press `^ + I` to open the incremental find panel
2. Search for the term `phone` in this document
3. Press ⏎ (`enter/return`) to exit the incremental find. If found, the search
   term will be preselected in the document.
4. Press `^ + I` and type `phone` again.
3. Cycle through all the occurrences using `^ + I`, press this multiple times
   until you get comfortable with this command.
4. Cycle in the opposite order using `^ + ⇧ + I`, press this multiple times
   until you get comfortable with this command.
5. Now press `⌥ + ⏎` to find all the instances of `phone` and enter
   `multiple selection` mode described in earlier module.
6. Press return (`escape`) to exit the multiple selection mode.
